# ETFD Repository

Welcome to the ETFD main repository. This repository serves as the central hub for all project-related source code, documentation, and task tracking.

## 📅 Way of Working

To maintain clarity and consistency across our collaborative efforts, we follow a strict commit message structure. Every commit must adhere to the following format:

```
<Action>on<Branch><Affected Item>
```

### Examples:
- `DeletedonAidan's branch<main.py>`
- `AddedonFeature-X<utils.py>`
- `UpdatedonMain<README.md>`

### Minor Changes
For smaller, non-structural improvements (like converting a loop into a list comprehension), use:
```
<Minor>on<Branch><Affected Item>
```
Example:
- `MinoronRefactorBranch<analysis.py>`

## 📝 Task Management

All tasks, progress tracking, and assignments are managed via our GitHub Project Board:

🔗 [ETFD Task Board](https://github.com/users/Christian-Stefan/projects/2)

Please refer to this board regularly to stay aligned with team priorities and deadlines.

## 🔗 Contributing
To contribute:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch from `main`
3. Commit using the prescribed format
4. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of changes

Thank you for helping us maintain a clean and efficient workflow!
